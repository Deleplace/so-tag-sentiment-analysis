To use this repository, it's recommended to get an API key from stackapps.com,
as this will greatly incease the daily quota of StackOverflow API queries you're
allowed.

First, run `fetch-all-questions` to gather data into a local directory. Then
run `analyze-question-sentiment` repeatedly on that data. Check out the flags
of both programs for further directions, by first running them with `-help`.
